        <p>
            Hi! I am a self-taught finance enthusiast who decided to formalize my capabilities and widen my skills at the University of Sussex. 
            As a mature and energetic second-year student, I am determined to maximize my academic years, deepen my technical knowledge, and refine my communication skills. 
            I relocated from Italy in 2019 to step out of my comfort zone and follow my ambitions. 
            Today, I am on a long-term path to improve financial literacy among the most vulnerable and leverage digital finance for a more equal society.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1rem;">
            Alongside my studies, I demonstrate leadership and time management by working part-time as a Team Leader in the hospitality sector for several years. 
            I am actively seeking an internship or placement to gain practical insight into roles related to my studies. While I cannot relocate at this time due to family commitments, 
            I hold a full driving license and am fully available to commute.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 40px; font-size: 1rem;">
            I am deeply committed to the university community as the Student Representative for my cohort for the second year in a row. 
            In this role, I act as a liaison between my cohort and the faculty, advocating for student needs and collaborating to improve the academic experience. 
            This responsibility continues to sharpen my negotiation and public speaking skills, while allowing me to network within the faculty and gain deep knowledge of the services available to students.

        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 40px; font-size: 1rem;">
            On a personal level, I enjoy traveling and exploring new places. 
            I recently participated in the departmental Study Trip to Prague, which was a fantastic experience. 
            I had the chance to attend a lecture on monetary policy at Charles University and take a guided tour of the Skoda factory.
            It provided a valuable opportunity to learn new things but also network with fellow students and the faculty members who led the trip.

        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 50px; font-size: 1rem;">
            I am dedicated to maximizing the value of my academic investment by fully leveraging the university's professional ecosystem. 
            I have gained extensive proficiency with industry-standard instruments, including <strong>Bloomberg Terminal</strong>, <strong>Statista</strong>, <strong>Fame</strong>, and the <strong>Financial Times</strong>. 
            Utilizing these platforms allows me to access reliable data, perform in-depth financial statement analysis, and formulate well-grounded opinions on contemporary economic topics.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 50px; font-size: 1rem;">
            Beyond technical skills, my university experience has mastered my ability to collaborate. Working on group presentations and reports has taught me to remain resilient in the face of challenges and conflicting viewpoints. 
            I pride myself on an inclusive approach, accommodating diverse perspectives and proactively ensuring every team member feels heard and valued. Please get in touch if you'd like to have a look at some of them!
            Furthermore, I have taken advantage of numerous skill-enhancement programs, such as in-person VC projects and Job Simulations on Forage, learning how to conceptualize and present complex ideas with clarity, detail, and accuracy.
